Simple JIRA add-on which allows a user to enter a String, containing any sort of characters and parenthesis "(" and ")".

To check if it works do the following: type 'gg' -> type 'manage addons' ->
check whether plugin is installed or not -> go to the 'Issues' - >
create custom field -> advanced -> BalancedParenthesis.

Then create some project and add a new field, choose BalancedParenthesis and try it out.

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
